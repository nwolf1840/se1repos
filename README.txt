ToDoApp:

This app allows users to create a "ToDo" list. There will
be an Add button which will add new ToDo items to the main Todo
list. In the main activity, the user can click on a made ToDo
item to be taken to another screen to ether mark complete, edit, or
delete the ToDo. If delete is clicked, the user will be taken to
a confirmation screen and will click yes or no to delete the ToDo.
There is also a picture in the main screen. The 
picture will reference this url at first: https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/megajump/images/2/27/Android_Robot.png

However, there will also be a button at the top which will allow
the user to enter a new url of a different picture to be displayed.
The app will also implement a broadcast receiver that will 
periodically notify the user of any uncompleted ToDos.
